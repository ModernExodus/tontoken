# Tontoken :dog: (A Decentralized Way of Helping Others)
Inspired by my adopted dog Tonto, this tradable ERC20 token aims to give back to organizations suggested and voted on by users.

## About
---
With all the memecoins and memestocks trending lately, many novice investors have raked in thousands of dollars in profits. However, all this back-and-forth trading of virtual tokens only benefits the parties directly involved. With current economic inequality in the world, many less fortunate individuals and nonprofit organizations are being left behind. Tontoken bridges the gap between this group of crypto traders and those who are struggling throughout the world. Tontoken can be traded just like any other ERC20 token over the Ethereum blockchain, but has charitable contributions built into its protocol. __These contributions have no impact on Tontoken transactions, so everyone can keep their profits while simultaneously helping others.__ Holders of Tontoken are entitled (but NOT required) to suggest and vote on organizations that receive contributions. The Tontoken protocol is entirely decentralized, so users have complete control.
